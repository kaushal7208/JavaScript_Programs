## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages :memo:



**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**



- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")

- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")

- Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to _50 characters or fewer_.

- Capitalize the Subject Line.

- Separate subject from body with a blank line.

- Do not end the subject line with a period.

- Wrap the body at _72 characters_.

- Use the body to explain the _what_, _why_, _vs_, and _how_.

- Reference [Issues](https://github.com/prasadsawant7/JavaScript_Programs/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/prasadsawant7/JavaScript_Programs/pulls) liberally after the first line.
